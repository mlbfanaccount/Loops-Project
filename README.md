# Loops Project

As soon as you run the code, it's pretty simple. You have five (5) choices, 4 of which give you some fun mathemitical calculations, and the fifth closes the program. The program keeps running until someone picks the fifth option to exit. 
1. is a factorial calculator, which I had to google what that even meant. I knew a factorial was basically x! on the calcuator but I didn't know what it did. I basically use google all the time to figure this coding stuff out.
2. A number pyramid based on the number of rows. so like if you pick 10 rows, it'll go from 1-10 on the bottom row, 1-9 on the second to last, etc with just 1 as the tip of the pyramid as the first row.
3. Sum of even or odd numbers. I wasn't even sure what this meant so I hope I did it right.
4. Reverse a string. Pretty straight forward, whatever you input will spit out the reverse of it. Pretty straightforward
5. Exit. Until you pick this option, you'll be able to try everything else as many times as you want. Pretty slick
